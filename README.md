# Eco-Switch-AI

🌱 Eco-Switch AI | Sustainable Transportation & Fuel Impact Analysis

Eco-Switch AI is a data-driven sustainability project developed as part of the 1M1B Green Internship (Batch 6).
The project focuses on analyzing vehicle fuel efficiency, fuel prices, and emission-related data to help users make more environmentally responsible transportation choices.

The system cleans and standardizes multi-source datasets related to vehicles, fuel types, mileage (KMPL), and pricing, and integrates them into an interactive application. Using data analytics and visualization, the project highlights the environmental and cost impact of different fuel options and vehicle models.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, sustainability metrics, and deployment using Python and Streamlit, while aligning with real-world goals such as carbon footprint reduction and informed decision-making.
